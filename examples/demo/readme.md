## WoT Framework Demo 

Run this demo with "node demo.js" to create a WoT server. 

Once the Wot server is running open a browser session at http://localhost:8888 and then click on the "Things" menu item to view and manage the demo things.
Please note the web server port is configured in the config file that is in the same directory as the demo.js file.
